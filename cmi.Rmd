## This rmd file was used to draft model formats for graphs and descriptive
## statistics for each mental health questionnaire. Only drafted depression and
## hypomania histograms, then moved over to creating all histograms in shiny
## app. Did the same for mean and standard deviation. Also commented interactive
## model code for alcoholism analysis. Also left in a few graphs that didn't end
## up getting included in the Shiny app, such as things like depression and
## alcoholism comorbidity and depression versus age.


# Loaded in necessary libraries.
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

# Read in df. Had to convert age from character to numeric.
updf <- read_csv("updf.csv") %>%
    mutate(Q4 = as.numeric(Q4))

# male and female datasets. 
female <- updf %>%
  filter(Q5 == 2)

male <- updf %>%
  filter(Q5 == 1)

# 4 datasets based on career income from comedy.

# If we look at this graph of depression versus alcohol consumption, we don't see much of a correlation. This could be because a large number of comedians have decided to go sober.

# Depression Histogram
```{r}
# Model histogram for depression, when in shiny app will replace "updf" with
# reactive dataframe. Used this histogram structure for all other mental illness scales, 
# just replaced 'Depression' with relevant variable name.
ggplot(updf, aes(x = Depression)) + 
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, color = "black", fill = "light blue")

# Model descriptive statistics for Depression. Used this for each questionnaire dataset.

  summarize(mean(Depression), sd(Depression))

#####For context, the bell curve for average depression inventory scores in control populations can be found here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34551/figure/F2/


# Hypomania Histogram
```{r}
# Model histogram for hypomania, when in shiny app will replace updf with
