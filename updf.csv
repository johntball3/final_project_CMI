It doesn’t help that when you start comedy they pay you with drinks which already sets you on a path to alcoholism.  And if you’re like me living in LA there’s after parties and drugs everywhere and comedy groupies everywhere so it is possibly the worst environment for someone with an addictive personality especially when people chastise you for not having a drink or partaking in the festivities.

I take a daily SNRI. I think comedy has helped me cope in many ways, if not just being engaged, and expressive, but I don't think a career in the arts is always great for my mental health. Although, I don't know if it could be any other way. I do know that drug abuse and alcohol use are probably too high for my community, but I also don't know if they could be very separate.

My understanding is that a large percentage of the population in general is medicated, and most people aren't comedians. It does seem that comedians are some of the most VOCAL people about their mental health issues, because that is sometimes the nature of the art and craft of comedy. You don't hear how many plumbers are depressed because it's not their job to speak about it, whereas it can be for a comedian. I'm also curious as to, even amongst comedians, are comedians with mental health issues more likely to even fill out this survey?

I always wanted to be an actress who was good at comedy. I would watch I Love Lucy and The Dick Van Dyke Show with my dad every time I was home sick from school. I loved Sally in The Dick Van Dyke Show. A single woman who hung out with funny guys all day and had her own life. I didn't realize that's who she was at the time, I just thought she was smart and funny. Lucy was just herself no matter what. I admired that these two women had strong points of view and did what they wanted. I know that now but as a kid I just thought they were funny. I still lack a strong point of view in my comedy because I use it as a need to please, I'll say anything that'll get a laugh. My parents were pretty volatile growing up. I could be screamed at/berated and hit for doing something that didn't bother them the day before. So to this day I have confidence issues and I use performing to combat negative self talk. What's hard for me in the improv/acting scene is I have to be social more than I like; when I get depressed I turn inward and won't leave my house. With performing I can't be isolated, I need to interact with my ensemble and I always feel better being around people than being isolated. I do struggle with finding the energy on stage when I feel a depression coming on and I do have brain fog, which impacts my listening and reaction time. That can be frustrating. What I like about performing and comedy is that you can always get better. I have never met a performer who is like, Done! I'm the perfect performer now. I like that the goal is always improving on the craft. At work, as a property manager, I know I'm always learning but honestly it's not the same. The ownership I have over my talent is far more important than the ownership I have over a leaking faucet.",1,4,1,4,4,5,2,5,4,4,1,5,4,5,4,5,2,4,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1, , , , , ,1,0,1,3,0,2,3,3,1,3,3,1,0,3,3,2,0,0,3,3,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,"Alcohol, in particular wine", ,"Three, there's a story where I grabbed my grandfather's beer off the coffee table and drank almost all of it before they stopped me.",3,1,3,3,2,0,0,3,0,1,It's my professional life that causes me to drink a lot.

In my show on the 16th I confessed my 19 years of clinical depression that my friends in the audience, some 20 people, never knew about. It was terrifically received and very liberating.

But one of the main reasons is because I see it as something immensely purposeful. Something that can shift culture and the world around me in a more positive direction. I wouldn't say I'm all about ""getting a laugh"" to me it's more about, ""giving a laugh."" It's using the funny talent you've been given and having the guts and discipline to go out and give it to the world. It's about fixing your frame of mind to help someone else. Saying something that makes some enjoy the moment! Laughter is incredible and contagious energy. I wouldn't say it always comes from a need to fuel your own egotism. Aside from being altruistic, it can also be a rather nice way of telling someone or someone's ideas to fuck off, a defense.

I don't really seem to fit with your survey. Sometimes I feel depressed, but I wouldn't say I have depression. I get to addicted to things... Helplessly addicted to things like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or touching my iPhone. Things that are designed to toy and puppeteer my brain. We all get addicted to things. Smarter people just get addicted to things that are productive and they call them good habits. I care enough about my health not to do drugs, because I know I'd get addicted to them too. And drugs cost a lot of money!

I don't like the system created for comedians, the bars and clubs. I'v done stand-up a handful of times but I wouldn't want to put myself through that gauntlet because it seems like low-life culture.

My goal is to be writer, Second City offers and inspiring path because it's an institution based on being funny. It's a way to be connected to a community who values funny. Because comedy is a valuable business, making people laugh is worth something! It makes a life of comedy feel uplifting, hopeful... open-mics at a dingy bar or shitty small-town local comedy circuit, not the same feeling.

Even if someone isn’t diagnosed, it seems like there’s usually something. Parks and Rec has a great line that’s something like “You’re too pretty to have needed to be funny” and I relate so much to that.

Jesters could make fun of anything serious and get praised instead of killed. Jokes give the joke teller power of over their situation. I was funny before I got ptsd, but I can trace the realization I was funny back to my very awkward puberty. Being funny got me through middle school.",30,15,8,8,2,0,1,3,1,6,4.25,4.75,2.75,3.25,4,23
