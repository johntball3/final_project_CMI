## Background
From towering figures like Robin Williams, Steve Martin, and Richard Pryor, people often assume 
that there is a positive relationship 
between comedy and mental illness. 

Go to any comedy open-mic or Netflix special, and approximately one-quarter of comedians will tell jokes 
about suicide attempts, substance abuse, depression, alcoholism, manic episodes, 
and unresolved trauma.
While the connection seems like a no-brainer to many individuals in the comedy industry, 
whether there is a genuine connection between comedy and mental illness, or it is manufactured as a part of performativity
is somewhat controversial. In some respects, comedians get paid to talk about their trauma; and 
in the words of one participant, "there are just as many depressed electricians as there are comedians; 
it's just that no one cares about electricians."
is it real or just a stereotype, projected onto the industry by media headlines 
and tabloid gossip about the next celebrity death by suicide or involvement in rehab program.
and if there is a relationship, 
however, no one has investigated why this correlation could exist. 


## Methods and Procedure
This study administered several mental health questionnaires to comedians, including the:
Mini-IPIP (a Big Five Personality Measure), 
the Hypomanic Personality Scale - Short Form, 
the CES-D (validated measure of depression), 
the O-LIFE (to replicate the Ando study), 
and the AUDIT (a valid alcoholism measure).

Our sample included  289 comedians, with a roughly even number of males and females. The sample is also broken down
into different professional levels. 52 comedians were professionals, 71 were pure hobbyists, 133 were amateurs pursuing
professional careers, and 33 receiving a mix of income for comedy performance and other work.

Participants were recruited via college comedy groups, professional comedy club comedian databases, and online comedy 
Facebook groups.
