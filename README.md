## Background
From towering figures like Robin Williams, Steve Martin, and Richard Pryor, people often assume 
that there is a positive relationship between comedy and mental illness. 

Up until this point, few studies have looked at cognitive aspects of comedians. None have looked at rates of depression, alcoholism, or bipolar disorder. And more importantly, none of these studies have explored why the correlation between comedy and mental illness could exist. 
This study analyses the rates of mental illness among comedians and explores potential mechanisms for why mental illness
could be more prevalent among this population.

This data was presented in 2018 at the Harvard Global Mental Health Conference, and the trailer for the presentation can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvKoFaCtho

## Methods and Procedure
We distributed an online survery via the following qualtrics link: https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2bjnjwogAVzzQ3z

This study administered several mental health questionnaires to comedians, including the:
Mini-IPIP (a Big Five Personality Measure), 
the Hypomanic Personality Scale - Short Form, 
the CES-D (validated measure of depression), 
the O-LIFE (to replicate the Ando study), 
and the AUDIT (a valid alcoholism measure).

Our sample included  289 comedians, with a roughly even number of males and females. The sample is also broken down
into different professional levels. 52 comedians were professionals, 71 were pure hobbyists, 133 were amateurs pursuing
professional careers, and 33 receiving a mix of income for comedy performance and other work.

Participants were recruited via college comedy groups, professional comedy club comedian databases, and online comedy 
Facebook groups. 

## Conclusions and Analysis

It is a known scientific fact that mental illness is more prevalent among creative professions. This study sought to replicate this finding among the comedy industry. From this data, we found that comedians experienced symptoms of mental illness at much higher rates than the control population. Comedians highest levels of abnormality in depression, alcoholism, and hypomanic symptoms.

As far as why this relationship could exist, art in many ways serves to regulate the symptoms of mental illness. 
While it could be the case that the comedy industry exposes comedians to high levels of stress, given that amateurs experienced mental illness at a rate very similar to that of professionals, it is unlikely that comedy "makes" people depressed. More importantly, it appears that there is a selection bias towards mentally ill individuals in the comedy industry, given that comedy functions as a coping mechanism for mental illness. According to the self-rated "Joy" plot, it appears that even among individuals who scored above 40 on the CES-D inventory, the rush of comedy performance is
able to directly counter the effects of depressive anhedonia. Furthermore, 62% said that comedy served as a coping mechanism for life events. Therefore, it is clear that a large proportion of comedians use comedy - aware of it or not - to directly counter the symptoms of mental illness.
